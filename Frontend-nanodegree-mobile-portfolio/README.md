Portfolio mobile optimization.

Hello,
1- open the index.html file to show the website.
2- take the link and check it in google pagespeed.

First of all i have optimized the pictures from google pagespeed tips.
after i have optimized the pictures i have minimized the CSS and Javascript, and removed the google font, and used the CSS in the index file.

for the pizza

1- open the pizza.html to show the website.
2- open the devtools to check the FPS meter.
3- try the slider.

I have declared a variable called pizzaDiv outside the loop and called it inside, and UpdatePositions i have declared phase and scrolltop outside the loop.
and in ChangePizzaSize  first process saves the pizza form and second loop takes out the shape of the pizza.

thank you.
